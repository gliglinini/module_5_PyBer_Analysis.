# module_5_PyBer_Analysis.
Using the Pandas groupby() function with the count() and sum() methods on PyBer DataFrame columns, get the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. Then, calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type. Finally, add this data to a new DataFrame, then format the columns.
